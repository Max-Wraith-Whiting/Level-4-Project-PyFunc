Initial brief was for language server and tooling for *Links Programming Language*.

Unfortunately, due to administration errors the project was assigned twice. I was given the opportunity to do one of several other projects, or an individual project.

It was agreed that we would meet again on the 22nd of September to ogranise the project idea.

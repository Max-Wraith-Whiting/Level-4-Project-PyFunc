# Project Proposal
A basic, yet general purpose programming language aimed at having a syntax easy for non technical parsing of programmatic thinking. (A syntax more akin to pseudo code, made for clarity not terseness.)

The fundamental idea of the proposal is to produce a simplified programming language that is expressly explicit in it's written form, supporting fundamental programming features whilst hiding their internal complexity to an as of yet unspecified degree. The aim is not to produce a competitive new language but to create a teaching aid that shows the fundamental structures and thinking regarding programming, in a plain readable format, without the complexity that a more mature language would entail. This proposed language should aim to include the following:

- A natural language style of syntax For example "x.append(y)" would be something like, "append y to x". Another example could be "while Q is not empty" coming from "while (Q != false)" [With the presumption of non-truthy data structures whilst empty.]
- A static type system, (The implementation complexity of which is variable.) Likely in the form of boxed types, i.e. "Number x = 15" as apposed to differing types for float, uint32 etc. The idea here, is to be more explicit than a dynamic type system could allow, whilst not so overly specific to become a major point of consideration.

- Additional features the language should include to give a more complete view of programming are:
	- Basic data structures: Lists, Dictionaries, Stacks, Queues (they could be wrappers of list in implementation) and possibly trees.
	- Simple control flow structures: "if", "else if" and "else".
	- Simplified iteration: "for each _ in _", "while _" and "do y while y".
	- Functions and Closures.
	- First class functions.
	- Function Overloading: Using the aforementioned type system to, at compile time, determine appropriate versions of functions for a given data type.
	- Basic objects, though more likely generic collections of data absent of class methods (akin to a raw struct).
	
```

We agreed that the proposal and idea needed work, and more specifically, needed a justification for merit and learning (not merely technical task, but an additional academic element).

The proposal will be rewritten, with consideration to the new direction of including a type system with parametric polymorphism via Hindley-Milner typing.

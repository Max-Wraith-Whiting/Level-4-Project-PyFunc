# Project Proposal: Development of a Functional Programming Language with Python-Like Syntax

## Project Overview

**Project Title:** PyFunc (Name T.B.A.) - A Python-Like Functional Programming Language

**Project Objectives:**

1. Develop a functional programming language with a Python-like syntax.
2. Address the limitations of Python, such as the inclusion of statements and the absence of a robust type system.
3. Implement a Hindley-Milner type system to provide strong and static type checking.
4. Enable parametric polymorphism to enhance code reusability and maintainability.
5. Create a user-friendly and readable language that encourages functional programming paradigms.

## Project Justification

Python is an immensely popular and versatile programming language known for its readability and ease of use. However, it is not primarily designed for functional programming, which can lead to challenges when writing purely functional code. Python includes statements, mutable data structures, and lacks a robust type system. These limitations can hinder the development of large-scale, maintainable, and error-free functional codebases.

Functional programming has gained traction in recent years due to its many advantages, including enhanced code reliability, better parallelism, and easier testing. Functional programming languages, like Haskell and OCaml, provide features such as immutability, first-class functions, and a strong type system based on Hindley-Milner, making them suitable for functional development. By creating a Python-like functional programming language, we aim to provide the following benefits:

- **Readability and Ease of Learning:** Leveraging Python's familiar syntax will lower the barrier to entry for developers new to functional programming, making it easier to transition to this paradigm.

- **Error Prevention:** A robust type system with Hindley-Milner type inference will catch errors at compile-time, reducing runtime errors and enhancing code reliability.

- **Improved Code Maintenance:** Functional programming techniques, like immutability and parametric polymorphism, simplify code maintenance and debugging.

## Project Scope

### Core Language Features

1. **Syntax and Semantics:** Develop a Python-like syntax that supports functional programming constructs such as pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions.

2. **Type System:** Implement a Hindley-Milner type system to provide strong, static typing while inferring types wherever possible.

3. **Functional Constructs:** Include essential functional programming constructs, such as map, filter, reduce, and lambda expressions.

4. **Parametric Polymorphism:** Support generic data types and functions to encourage code reuse.

5. **Immutable Data Structures:** Provide a set of immutable data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
